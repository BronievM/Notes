# Notes â€“ Course Project  

This is my course project, created during my studies at Khmelnytskyi Polytechnic College.  

## About the Program  

**Notes** is an application that allows you to conveniently store all necessary records in one place and send notifications to your phone if needed (unfortunately, in this version, notifications do not work perfectly).  

## Key Features  

- Modern and simple user interface  
- Easy to use  

## Limitations  

- The application cannot run on PCs with an operating system older than Windows 10  
- Competing applications offer cloud storage, which helps them gain more downloads
